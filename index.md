# Experience

## Xiaomi  (2016.08 - Present)

**Position:  SDE (Backend),  Team: MiLive,  Major Language: C/C++ **

### Revenue System of MiLive

The revenue system is the general term for a series of core projects in MiLive, including recharge & purchase & withdraw & risk control etc. I have been working on these projects since I joined Xiaomi on 2016.08, and been in charge of the revenue system in the beginning of this year. Now I am the leadership of a team which contains two developer. I am responsible for,

- Accessing more than 10 kinds of popular third-party financial services in China and aboard; Refactoring the architecture of recharge service, which improved the success rate significantly.
- Designing and implementing new services, such as red-envelope & one-by-one-pay-chat and so on.
- Optimizing the architecture of the revenue system to make them more reliable and turning them into mircoservices architecture. Other apps of our business group could access these financial services insteal of building their own. 
- Setting up monitoring for each core revenue system module, could monitor the real-time success rate.

In this work experience, I have summed up a set of business models suitable for revenue proejcts which can effectively improve business success rate. After becoming the project leader, via standardizing the development process and sorting out the past experience, we improved the project quality significantly. There is ZERO online-bug about core revenue projects until now.

The highest accuracy of the model can reach 96%.
